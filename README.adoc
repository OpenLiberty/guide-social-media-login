NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website^].

Learn how to secure a RESTful web service with the Open Liberty Social Media Login feature.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to secure a simple RESTful web service using the https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login feature^]. You will secure an existing service,
`HelloService` using social media https://oauth.net/2[OAuth2^] and https://openid.net/connect[OpenID Connect^].

`HelloService` is an existing microservice that responds to a `GET` request with a Plain Text response that looks like this:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
Hello, friend!
----

Instead of securing your `HelloService` service by implementing your own authentication service,
you can allow users to authenticate to your service using social media accounts.
This will allow you to provide a secure authentication method for your users without having to explicitly implement it.

Open Liberty provides a https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login feature^]
that provides configuration elements that allows you to use Facebook, Google, Github, Linkedin for authentication,
or to configure a custom OAuth2 or OpenID Connect provider.

By the end of this guide, you will secure your `HelloService` service with three social media login choices:

1. Github login
2. Amazon login
3. Google login

== Setting up the certificates and trust store

Before you can build the application, you will need to add the social media domains' certificates to the trust store for social media login.
The application you will build in this guide requires certificates for Amazon, Google and Github to be added to the trust store.
You also need to create certificates that your application will provide for HTTPS connections. This certificate and private key will need to be added to the key store for social media login.
Lastly, you need to create applications on the three social media developer platforms to obtain a client ID and client secret to use their APIs.

First, navigate to the `start/src/main/liberty/config/resources/security` directory.

To get the certificates for Amazon, Google and Github, you can use `openssl` or a browser.
Use the following URLs to get the certificates for each service:

- Google: https://developers.google.com/
- Github: https://developer.github.com/
- Amazon: https://developer.amazon.com/

For example, open the website on Firefox.

1. Click on the button next to "Connection Secure".
2. Click on "More Information".
3. Click on "View Certificate".
4. Download each certificate in the chain as a separate `PEM` file.

Once you have the certificates downloaded, you need to add them to the trust store.
As part of the guide, you will configure the application's trust store to be `slts.p12` whose password is `changeit`.

To add a certificate to the trust store, substitute `<certificate-file-name>` with the name of the downloaded certificate
and `<certificate-alias>` with an alias you wish to give the certificate in the following command and run it.
[role='command']
```
keytool -import -trustcacerts \
        -file <certificate-file-name> \
        -alias <certificate-alias> \
        -keystore slts.p12 \
        -storetype PKCS12 \
        -storepass changeit
```
The command also creates the trust store file if it doesn't exist.

Add each of the certificates that you downloaded to the `slts.p12` trust store.

To generate certificates for your service to use for HTTPS connections, run the following command:
[role='command']
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

Before the certificate and private key can be imported into the key store for your service, it needs to be converted into one `PKCS12` bundle.
Combine your key and certificate by running the following command:
[role='command']
```
openssl pkcs12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -export -out certificate.p12
```

The key store to be used by social media login will be configured to be `key.p12` whose password is `changeit`.
To import your certificate bundle into this key store, run the following command:
[role='command']
```
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore key.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12
```

To use the new key store and trust store, copy these files into `src/main/liberty/resources/security`
in the `start` and `finish` directories.

The last prerequisite step is obtaining client ID and client secret for access to the three social media developer APIs.

In order to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google, visit the https://console.developers.google.com/[Google API Console].
Set the redirect URL to `https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/social-login/redirect/googleOIDCLogin`.

In order to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials for Amazon, follow the steps here: https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/amazon.
Set the redirect URL to `https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/social-login/redirect/amazonLogin`.

In order to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials for Github, follow the steps here: https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/github.
Set the redirect URL to `https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/social-login/redirect/githubLogin`.

Enter the client IDs and client secrets to `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` in the `start` folder.

== Securing HelloService

First, navigate to the `start` directory.

[role="code_command", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Update this `HelloService` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/sociallogin/HelloService.java`
---- 

The [hotspot=helloService]`HelloService` class is the JAX-RS service that you will be securing.
Add the [hotspot=rolesAllowed]`@RolesAllowed({"users"})` annotation to restrict access to the service to users who are
in the `Users` role.

Next, you will replace the `return "Hello, friend!";` to output user information instead of `friend`.

First, add the [hotspot=httpServletRequestContext]`HttpServletRequest` context.
Next, use [hotspot=userPrincipal]`request.getUserPrincipal()` to get information about the logged in user.

HelloService.java

---- 

== Configuring the security and social media login

[role="code_command", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Replace this `server.xml` class.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
---- 

server.xml 
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column'] 
---- 
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=**;!copyright;]
---- 

Replace the contents of `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`.
The explanation for these changes are in the following sections.

=== Configuring the security roles

The [hotspot=applicationBnd]`application-bnd` configuration element under the
[hotspot=webApplication]`webApplication` configuration element creates a new security role `users`,
which all authenticated users belong to.
Adding this allows users that are authenticated using social media login to access your `HelloService` service.

=== Adding required features

The following OpenLiberty [hotspot=features]`feature elements` enable Social Media Login and other related features:

[role="command"]
----
<feature>appSecurity-3.0</feature>
<feature>transportSecurity-1.0</feature>
<feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
<feature>ssl-1.0</feature>
<feature>jwt-1.0</feature>
----

There are some prerequisite configurations that social media login configuration elements need:

1. A `keyStore` configuration element that corresponds to the key store created in the prerequisites section
2. A `keyStore` configuration element that corresponds to the trust store created in the prerequisites section
3. An `ssl` configuration element for configuring the SSL configuration that is used to connect to the social media

=== Adding key store and trust store

In the first section, you created two key stores, `slts.p12` and `key.p12`.
Now you will configure your application to use these key stores.
Files in the `src/liberty` folder are copied into the location specified by `${server.output.dir}`,
so the location of these key stores is `${server.output.dir}/resources/security`.

The [hotspot=keystore]`defaultKeyStore` configuration element whose location is `${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.p12`
will be used to provide SSL certificates when initiating HTTPS connections for social media login.
Provide the password that you used when creating the key store.

The [hotspot=truststore]`socialLoginKeyStore` configuration element whose locaiton is `${server.output.dir}/resources/security/slts.p12`
will be used to store trusted certificates when initiating HTTPS connections to social media APIs for authorization and authentication.
Provide the password that you usd when creating the trust store.

The [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration element which references [hotspot=keystore]`defaultKeyStore` as the key store
and [hotspot=truststore]`socialLoginKeyStore` as the trust store will be provided to social media login configurations.

=== Adding Github login configuration

The [hotspot=githubLogin]`githubLogin` configuration element will configure Github login.
The `clientId` and `clientSecret` for [hotspot=githubLogin]`githubLogin` should be the credentials you created for your Github application
in the prerequisites section. The `sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.

=== Adding Amazon login configuration

The [hotspot=amazonLogin]`amazonLogin` configuration uses a custom `oauth2Login` configuration element.
The `clientId` and `clientSecret` for [hotspot=amazonLogin]`amazonLogin` should be the credentials you created for your Amazon application
in the prerequisites section. The `sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.
The following attributes are set for your [hotspot=amazonLogin]`oauth2Login` configuration element:

- `responseType`: `code`
- `tokenEndpointAuthMethod`: `client_secret_post`
- `authorizationEndpoint`: `https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa`
- `tokenEndpoint`: `https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token`
- `scope`: `profile`
- `userApi`: `https://api.amazon.com/user/profile`
- `userNameAttribute`: `name`
- `userUniqueIdAttribute`: `user_id`
- `website`: `www.amazon.com`
- `displayName`: `Amazon`

Further documentation on these attributes can be found on the https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/oauth2Login.html[Open Liberty config reference on `oauth2Login`].
The values for these attributes can be found in the https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/minitoc-lwa-overview.html[Login With Amazon API documentation].

Make sure that the `id` of your [hotspot=amazonLogin]`oauth2Login` configuration matches the redirect URL (if you set the `id` to `amazonLogin`, the redirect URL must end with `.../amazonLogin`).

=== Adding Google login configuration

The [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`googleOIDCLogin` configuration uses a custom `oidcLogin` configuration element.
The `clientId` and `clientSecret` for [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`googleOIDCLogin` should be the credentials you created for your Google application
in the prerequisites section. The `sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.
The following attributes are set for your [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`oidcLogin` configuration element:

- `displayName`: `Google`
- `authorizationEndpoint`: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`
- `tokenEndpoint`: `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token`
- `jwksUri`: `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`
- `scope`: `openid profile email`
- `userNameAttribute`: `email`
- `realmNameAttribute`: `iss`
- `issuer`: `https://accounts.google.com`

Further documentation on these attributes can be found on the https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/oidcLogin.html[Open Liberty config reference on `oidcLogin`].
The values of these attributes can be found in the https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google API documentation].

Make sure that the `id` of your [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`oidcLogin` configuration matches the redirect URL (if you set the `id` to `googleOIDCLogin`, the redirect URL must end with `.../googleOIDCLogin`).

== Building and running the application

The Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide and all the 
changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/api/hello[^] URL.

When the server updates its configuration, when you access https://localhost:9080/api/hello[the endpoint for Hello service],
you should be redirected to a Social Media Login Form. This form allows you to choose which login provider you want to use
for authentication. When you select a login choice, you will be redirected to the login page of that service.

Try logging in using your social media accounts. After authenticating, you will be redirected back to https://localhost:9080/api/hello and the response will look like this:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
Hello, <<your username>>
WSPrincipal:<<your username>>
----

== Testing the service

You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
http://localhost:9080/api/hello[^] URL. Automated tests are a much better
approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client
API provide a simple environment to test the application.

You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server, or they
can be written to call the application server directly. In this example, you will create a test that
does the latter.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `EndpointIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java`
----

EndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=comment"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/sociallogin/EndpointIT.java[]
----

This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common.
The test method is indicated with the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` annotation.

To call the JAX-RS service using the JAX-RS client, first create a `WebTarget` object by calling
the [hotspot=target]`target` method that provides the URL. To cause the HTTP request to occur, the [hotspot=requestget]`request().get()` method
is called on the `WebTarget` object. The [hotspot=requestget]`get` method
call is a synchronous call that blocks until a response is received. This call returns a [hotspot=requestget]`Response`
object, which can be inspected to determine whether the request was successful.

The first thing to check is that a `200` response was received. The JUnit [hotspot=assertequals]`assertEquals` method can be used for this check.

Check the response body to ensure it returned the right information.
You need to check whether the request gets redirected to the social media login form.
You can do this by looking for the string [hotspot=assertredirect]`"Social Media Selection Form"` in the response string.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press
`enter/return` key to run the tests. You will see the following output:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.884 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the social media login form.

When you are done checking out the service, exit development mode by typing `q` in the shell session where
you ran the server and then pressing the `enter/return` key.


== Great work! You're done!

You secured and tested a simple RESTful web service in Open Liberty by using the Social Media Login feature.
